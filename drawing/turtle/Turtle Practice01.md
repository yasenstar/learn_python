# Learn Turtle in Python
dateï¼š 2020-07-14

Open Python through terminal, by typing `python3`, enter.

Today, let's use Turtle to draw some shapes, withing using loops feature.

Before using the turtle, we need to import the turtle module and create the Pen object:

```python
import turtle
t = turtle.Pen()
```

Here is the first basic code we can create a square:

```python
t.forward(100)
t.left(90)
t.forward(100)
t.left(90)
t.forward(100)
t.left(90)
t.forward(100)
t.left(90)
t.forward(100)
```

If you don't want to typing in so many lines, let's use FOR loop, remember using `t.reset()` to clear the Turtle screen:

```python
t.reset()
for x in range(1, 5):
    t.forward(100)
    t.left(90)
```

Question: we draw 4 lines, why here we set 1 to 5?

Answer: In Python loop, the times of loop is to maximum number - 1.

Today's playing: Drawing 2 different starts.

First, let's draw a 8-edge stars:

```python
t.reset()
for x in range(1,9): # remember 9 - 1 = 8 means we have 8 edges, not 9
    t.forward(100)
    t.left(225)
```

Second, we draw another different style star:

```python
t.reset()
for x in range(1, 38):
    t.forward(100)
    t.left(175)
```

Change the parameters:

```python
t.reset()
for x in range(1,20):
    t.forward(100)
    t.left(95)
```

Finally, see what's this drawing?

```python
t.reset()
for x in range(1,19):
    x.forward(100)
    if x % 2 == 0:
        t.left(175)
    else:
        t.left(225)
```
